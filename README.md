CourseMate:
Everyone and their brother uploads their schedules onto Facebook. Why not find out which of your friends are in your classes in the process? CourseMate does this for you! Done (or rather not done) in under 24 hours for the Waterloo Facebook Hackathon by Owen, Roxanne, Jack, and Michael. 
Also check out <a href="https://github.com/JJackJi/CourseMateService">the OCR portion</a> of it.
